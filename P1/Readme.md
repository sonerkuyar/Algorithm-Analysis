# Detailed Analysis of a complicated algorithm
This Project made by [Soner Kuyar](www.github.com/sonerkuyar) and Yunus Kağan Aydın for the course of Analysis of Algorithms CMPE300.
All mathmatical analysis and experiments are in the analysis.pdf file.
## How to Execute the Code

Prerequisites:
Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.
Libraries:
The code uses only implicit python libraries timeit and random
Execution:
Run the script in a Python environment with following script:
python <student_number>.py
## Output
Expected output example will be like:
Case: best Size: 1 Elapsed Time (s): 0.0000001234
Case: worst Size: 1 Elapsed Time (s): 0.0000005678
Average Times: 0.0000002345 0.0000003456 0.0000004567 0.0000005678 0.0000006789 0.0000007890 0.0000008901 0.0000009012 0.0000010123 0.0000011234
